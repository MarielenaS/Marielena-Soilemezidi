# Marielena Soilemezidi


**Marielena Soilemezidi** is a PhD student at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), and a member of the [Lab of Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics at NKUA](https://psychoneurolinglab-en.phil.uoa.gr/home/); her dissertation titled _"Morphosyntactic Production and Processing in Agrammatic Aphasia"_ focuses on linguistic comprehension and production of temporal reference (past/future) and aspect (perfective/non-perfective) in Greek speaking individuals with non-fluent aphasia. Her thesis is supervised by Prof. Spyridoula Varlokosta (NKUA), Dr. Valantis Fyndanis (Cyprus University of Technology, CUT), and Prof. Athanasios Protopapas (University of Oslo, UiO).

Her PhD is funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation ([H.F.R.I.](https://www.elidek.gr/en/homepage/), 3rd Call for PhD Fellowships, Fellowship Number: 6161).

She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Philology with a specialization in Linguistics from NKUA and a [Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience of Language](https://www.bcbl.eu/en/study-with-us/masters-cognitive-neuroscience-language) from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) with collaboration with the Basque Center for Cognition, Brain and Language ([BCBL](https://www.bcbl.eu/es)). Her master thesis was an eye-tracking study, investigating time reference in healthy Spanish speaking adults, supervised by Dr. Simona Mancini (BCBL) and Dr. Nicoletta Biondo (University of Siena).

Marielena is also affiliated with the University of Oslo (UiO), working as a research assistant for the Center for Multilingualism Across the Lifespan ([MultiLing Lab](https://www.hf.uio.no/multiling/english/topics/lab/about-the-lab/)) for the project _“Morphosyntactic Production in Stroke-induced Agrammatic Aphasia: A Cross-linguistic Machine Learning Approach”_ of Dr. Valantis Fyndanis. 

Her research interests include acquired language disorders (principally aphasia), and neurobiology of language with a focus on neural correlates of syntactic processing.
